# Week 3 Overview Video

+ Easter egg references to 5140 & 5142 - ignore these
+ Wednesday noon Pacific office hours
+ Collaboration

    + All about learning SQL
    + Big fan of collaboration as long as you learn SQL and Mongo DB

+ SQL: 
    
    + Dates:
        + '2022-04-06' format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
        + this is the true chronological way
        + largest magnitude -> smallest magnitude YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS
    + Concatenation:
        + Prefer + rather than |
    + CAST
        + ensure column is the right data type
    + Always start new query from correct DB you want
        + Can also check the master DB (dropdown in top left) 
    + Build queries in stages
        + DateHired AS [Date Hired] -> Formats column headings 
        
+ DTC

    + Take a look at it now and think about it throughout other modules
    + AdventureWorksDW2017 (Data Warehouse)
        + NOT the same as AdventureWorks2017
    + Test to see if I can access the DW
    + DTC due Week 10 before final
    + Groups OK: 3-4 people max
    + Technical Report
    + Executive Memo

# Chp 7 SETS

## 03-01-01 SETS

+ Dataset is the end result of a query
+ Dataset is the base element that we run analyses on 
+ Sets or Data Sets

    + How we look at the world of data - what we see in a spreadsheet
    + Single column of data
    + Multiple columns from 1 table
    + Multiple columns from multiple tables
    + Table columns and calculated columns
    
+ Queries return sets

    + table columns 
    + AND
    + column created with expressions
    + Rows are "members of a Set
    + Simple and Complex data sets

+ Operations

    **1. Intersection
    2. DIfference
    3. Union**

## 03-01-02 INTERSECTION

+ Idea of looking at one or more datasets
+ Recipes with beef + Recipes with onions

    + INTERSECTION <- recipes with BOTH beef and onions
    + want to find the overlapping area and find the commonality
    
+ Usage

    + Combines one or more sets to create a new single set
    + e.g. customers who purchased multiple kitchen items
    
+ Commands

    **1. INTERSECT
    2. JOIN**
    + INTERSECT Limitation:
        + Sets being compared MUST have the EXACT SAME columns
        
+ INTERSECT

    1. SELECT DISTINCT OrderNumber  
       FROM Order_Details
       WHERE ProdCat = 'Bicycle'
      
       INTERSECT
    
    2. SELECT DISTINCT OrderNumber  
       FROM Order_Details
       WHERE ProdCat = 'Helmets'
    + we want this to be a single list
    
    3. SELECT DISTINCT OrderNumber, OrderDate  
       FROM Order_Details
       WHERE ProdCat = 'Bicycle'
       
       INTERSECT
       
       SELECT DISTINCT OrderNumber  
       FROM Order_Details
       WHERE ProdCat = 'Helmets'
       
        + ^ This yields an ERROR because OrderDate is not in second query. MUST have SAME columns
        + INTERSECT can't resolve problems like this
    


## 03-01-03 DIFFERENCE

+ This is about excluding items found int he dataset

+ Recipes with Beef but Not Onions
+ Recipes with Beef but No Onions or Carrots
+ Usage
    
    + Creating new set by eleminating matching items in other sets
    + Customers who purchased kitchen items but not mixers
    
+ Limitations

    + Sets being compared must have the same columns
    
+ EXCEPT

    1. SELECT EqpID FROM
       FROM Equipment
      
       EXCEPT
      
    2. SELECT EqpID FROM WorkOrders
       WHERE IS NULL Closed Date
       
       + Returns ProductIDs that do NOT have a workorder
       
    3. Select CustomerKey FROM InternetSales
       
       EXCEPT
       
    4. SELECT CUstomerKey FROM Customers
       WHERE CustomerGender = 'F';
       
       + Explicit exclusion which includes everything else

## 03-01-04 UNION

+ Combining elements from multiple sets
+ Orders for a Bicycle or a Helmet
+ Usage

    + Creates a new set by combining items in other sets
    + Looking at a customers current AND historical sales
    
+ Limitations

    + Sets being compared MUST have the same columns
    
+ Data Warehouse - retired data sits in DW to free up space in transactional DB
+ UNION

    + join tables together 
    + single list of contact details for all customers and suppliers
        + Tables: CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER
        + Need: single set of contact details from both details
    + write 2 SELECT statements
    
    1. SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, FirstName + '' + LastName AS ContactName, City, Country, Phone
       FROM Customer
       
       UNION
       
       SELECT 'Supplier' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country, Phone
       FROM Supplier
       
          + created literal: 'Customer' and 'Supplier'
          + Supplier table just uses "ContactName" since it was created in first query
          + Columns must match exactly
          + Use UNION to combine disparate data from separate tables to create 1 single dataset
          
+ JOIN will help to avoid limitation of need "same columns" between tables

# Chp 8 JOIN

## JOIN Basics

+ Bring data together from multiple tables to create new datasets to have everything you need in an elegant way

+ List all employees and their managers who are in the Sales department

    + people change jobs over time
    + grab employee, find entry where they currently work, and compare in departments to see if they're on sales team, then find the manager
    
+ JOIN options

    + INNER JOIN
    + LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN
    + FULL OUTER JOIN
    + CROSS JOIN
    
+ JOIN

    + Linking of two tables or result sets
    + Based on the intersection of specified columns
    + Part of the FROM clause
    + Legal
        + Usually on PK and FK on two tables
        + If not on PK or FK, **Join columns must have the same data type**
            + must CAST as different data type if doing this
    + INNER JOIN
        + Creates a result set that contains mathes from 2 tables or data sets
        + **BUT... only matches**
        + makes sure return set is only information that is matching in both tables
    + OUTER JOIN
        + Creates a result set where one table's values are always listed and only matching data from the other table is included
        + returns anything that matches, but always gives list from LEFT or RIGHT table (depending on LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)


## INNER JOIN part 1

## Assignments and midterm

+ Midterm exam - based off AdventureWorks DB
+ Focus on professionalism 
+ Structure queries in professional manner

## Questions for Snodgrass - Office Hours Wednesday 4/13/2022 noon

1. Need help understanding how to JOIN on matching values (# 5 on Sales Order DB)
2. Need help understanding embedding SELECT statements
3. Need help understanding embedding JOINS within JOINS
4. In School Database, what does connection in Subject table that points to itself mean?
5. Can you JOIN any table in any order as long as they have a direct connection / PK-FK relationship?
5. Planning to team up with Jordan Gropper for DTC

+ Everything after the FROM is creating a temporary dataset. Run these chunks and see 

+ Finds matches between the tables or datasets
    
    + If a match is NOT found, the row(s) in both tables are filtered out
    + will only return things that have an actual match
    + List all employees and their titles
    + SELECT **employees**.last_name, **titles**.title
      FROM employees INNER JOIN titles ON
      **employees**.emp_no = **titles**.emp_no;
        + looking at emp_no for matches
        + since comparing across multiple tables, need to dot.notation to explicitly show what table its referencing
        
+ AdventureWorks

    + Every person is assigned a BusinessEntityID
        + Employee linked to Person via BusinessEntityID
    + SELECT person.BusinessEntityId,
      person.LastName,
      HumanResources.Employee.JobTitle
      FROM Person.Person INNER JOIN 
      HumanResources.Employee ON
      Person.BusinessEntityID = Employee.BusinessEntityID;


## INNER JOIN part 2

+ joining multiple tables together
+ order is important
+ List all employees and their title and their salary

    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title, s.salary
      FROM (employees AS e 
      INNER JOIN titles AS t 
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no)
      INNER JOIN saaries AS s
      ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;
        + use letter.notation to represent the tables
        + parantheses for order of precedence
        + first table of sequence should be main table that you're getting data from
        + will find every match from these 3 tables
        + it's all based on the employee number ("emp_no")
    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title, s.salary
      FROM (employees AS e 
      INNER JOIN titles AS t 
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no)
      INNER JOIN saaries AS s
      ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
      WHERE IS NULL(s.to_date) AND
      IS NULL(t.to_date)
        + this returns this employee, current title, and current salary
        + want to avoid getting all end results (all matches) - just need the CURRENT entry
        
+ JOINS on Non-Key Fields

    + Usually results in multiple entries
    + Recommend using DISTINCT
    + SELECT DISTINCT e.last_name, b.contact, v.birth_date
      FROM employees as e
      INNER JOIN customers as c
      ON e.birth_date = c.birth_date;
  

# Chp 9 OUTER JOIN

+ JOIN - all about combining data between different tables and different datasets
+ grab information that exists between many differnt tables and bring it all together
+ INNER JOIN

    + Creates a result set that contains matches from 2 tables or datasets
    + **BUT... only matches**
    + All about matching
    
+ OUTER JOIN

    + Creates a result set where one table's values are always listed and only matching data from the other table is included

## OUTER JOIN Types

+ OUTER JOIN options

    + LEFT OUTER JOIN
        + Return everything from Table A (regardless of matches with Table B) and only matches from Table B
    + RIGHT OUTER JOIN
        + Return everything from Table B (regardless of matches with Table A) and only matches from Table A
    + FULL OUTER JOIN
        + Pick everything from Table A and Table B plus all matches

## OUTER JOIN

+ List all employees and their titles

    + All employees that actually have titles: INNER JOIN
    + All employees with titles if not NULL: LEFT OUTER JOIN
    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title
      FROM employees AS e
      INNER JOIN titles AS t
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no;
    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title
      FROM employees AS e  # employees is left table
      LEFT JOIN titles AS t  # titles is right table
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no;  # based on matching employee number
      
+ LEFT JOIN Questions

    + All students and the classes they've registered for.
    + All equipment and their output performance.
    + All customers and their sales volume this year.
    
    + Datasets return ALL rows from one side, whether they have registerd or have performance data or made any purchases
    
+ RIGHT OUTER JOIN

    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title
      FROM employees AS e
      RIGHT JOIN titles AS t
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no;
    
    + Returns ALL titles, whether someone is assigned to it or not
    + Excludes employees that don't have titles

+ Practice in AdventureWorks2012

## OUTER JOIN Exception

+ Allows us to ask and find exceptions
+ Sometimes need to comb thru dataset to find what's missing instead of what's there

+ Exception Questions:

    + Which students have NOT registered for classes
        + OUTER JOIN students to classes registerd to find NULL students
    + All equipment missing output performance
    + All customers without sales this year
    + Employee titles not in use

<br>

![](Outer_Join_Exceptions.png)

+ Use LEFT and RIGHT OUTER JOINs with WHERE claus
    
    + Include "WHERE B.Key IS NULL" 
        + Give me all data from Table A that have no match in Table B
        
    + SELECT e.emp_no, t.title
      FROM employees AS e
      RIGHT JOIN titles AS t
      ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no
      WHERE e.emp_NO IS NULL;
        + Returns ALL titles where no one is assigned to them
        
+ Practice in Adventure Works

    + SELECT sp.BUsinessEntityID, sp.CommissionPct, sp.SalesYTD, sp.SalesLastYear, sp.Bonus,
        st.TerritoryID, st.Name, st.[Group], st.SalesYTD
      FROM Sales.SalesTerritory AS st
      LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory AS st
      ON st.TerritoryID = sp.TerritoryID
      WHERE st.TerritoryID IS NULL
      ORDER BY st.TerritoryID, sp.BusinessEntityID;

## FULL OUTER JOIN

+ "the everything join" - combines all rows from both tables
+ NOT the same as UNION

    + select 1 table and UNION with another table: this stacks Table A on top of Table B ON exactly matching set of columns
    
+ employees with titles, employees without titles, and titles not assigned to any employees
+ Exceptions - things that do not match on either side
+ Usage

    + For Data Warehouse processes, which often have complete rows with NULL columns
        + Combining Sales data from each region
    + For Exception Analysis
        + Matches and Orphans
        + **This is what Analysts would be interested in finding**
    + To find rows not included in INNER JOINs
        + Want to see everything and sort it by its exceptions
        + Excellent way to know if you have all the data you're supposed to have
        + Must be able to know what's NOT in the data is just as important as knowing what's IN the data
        + Full Outer Join can be used to compare tables to know instantly if they have the same data in it
    + Comparing to tables that should be the same

+ "Everything" Questions
    
    + All customers and suppliers
        + SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Country AS CustomerCountry,
            s.Country AS SupplierCountry, s.CompanyName
          FROM Customer AS c
          FULL JOIN Supplier AS s
          ON c.Country = s.Country
          ORDER BY c.Country, s.Country;

+ Practice in AdventureWorks2012

## OUTER JOIN Multiple Tables

+ List all employees and title with their salary (whether they have a title or a salary or not) 

    + SELECT e.last_name, t.title, s.salary
      FROM ((employees AS e
      LEFT JOIN titles AS t  # full list of employees regardless of having a title or not
        ON e.emp_no = t.emp_no)
      LEFT JOIN salaries AS s
        ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no)
      WHERE ISNULL(s.to_date) AND
        ISNULL(t.to_date)
